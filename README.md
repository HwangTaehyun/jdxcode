My name is Jeff. I also go by JD if there are too many other Jeffs around. I've been writing software for a long time and have spent a good while in the dev tool space. I think a ton about how us developers do our jobs and how we can improve our tools to make better software quicker.

I hate how difficult software is to learnâ€”particularly for new engineers. If I'm able to do anything in my career well, I hope that it's making things a little easier for the people that are new here.

### Open source work I've done

* [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) - an [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) clone built in rust
* [oclif](https://github.com/oclif/oclif) - Node.JS CLI Framework
* [chim](https://github.com/jdxcode/chim) - a tool for making shims that fetch remote binaries
* [gh](https://github.com/jdxcode/gh) - (not the [official github cli](cli.github.com/)) makes it easy to switch between github projects locally
* [Heroku CLI](https://github.com/heroku/cli)
